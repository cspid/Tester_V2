//Leaning into Syds room

[$PlayerName]: Hi there Syd! Would you like to come to bingo today? Should be a good one.
skip:
[$Character3First]: (Glumly) Oh. Hey [$PlayerName]. 
skip:
...
skip:
[$PlayerName]: How are you doing today? Everything alright with you?
skip:
[$Character3First]: I'm fine. I don't want to go to bingo today.

[[Syd, tell me what's really going on with you|Pushy_Syd_Day_6]]
[[Fair enough. You want me to turn the T.V. on for you?|Flippant_Syd_Day_6]]
[[I understand, some days I kinda just want to be alone too.|Empathetic_Syd_Day_6]]

[$Character3First]: I think literally every resident here as well as half the staff have asked me at some point - "Do you have a wife?" And when I say no, they look at me sympathetically and shake their heads. "So she passed away? I'm so sorry to hear that. How long has it been?"

[[Some men just never meet the right woman, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.|Dumb_Syd_Day_6]]
[[What do you want them to ask you Syd?|Probing_Syd_Day_6]]

[$Character3First]: It's just... people make so many presumptions. Sometimes I think it's because they're just being careless, but sometimes I think it's because they don't want me to tell them something they don't want to hear.
skip:
[$PlayerName]: How do you mean?
skip:
[$Character3First]: Like, they ask me about my "wife" so that I wont tell them what a wonderful man my partner is. So they wont have to hear me talk about how much it breaks my heart that when he visits I have to introduce him as my "friend", and we have to surpress any kind of love or affection we might feel for eachother, because heaven forbid, we might make someone feel uncomfortable. 

[[Syd, I'm so sorry. I didn't know.|DidntKnow_Syd_Day_6]]
[[You don't come across as being gay, maybe that's why people assume you have a wife.|DontSeemGay_Syd_Day_6]]

[$PlayerName]: I wont tell anyone. But Syd, if I'm being honest I hate seeing how miserable this is making you. I want you to have a real home here, and I think you want that too. 
skip:
[$Character3First]: Of course. 
skip:
[$PlayerName]: Would you be willing to talk with some of the management here about your situation? It sounds like these kinds of issues haven't been fully thought through in terms of our policies. Your story might be able to help change that.
skip:
[$Character3First]: I highly doubt it. I get the feeling the people who run this place would much rather people like me stay quiet and not make a fuss. 

[[To be honest, that sounds about right.|Keep_Secret_2_Syd_Day_6]]
[[I'm not saying you're wrong, but it might be worth the risk at this point.|Keep_Secret_2_Syd_Day_6]]
[[I'm certain they'll do the right thing.|Keep_Secret_2_Syd_Day_6]]

skip:
[$Character3First]: I really do. 
skip:
[$Character3First]: Let me sleep on it. 
skip:
[$PlayerName]: Of course, take your time. I've got to run - last chance to change your mind about bingo...
skip:
[$Character3First]: Ha! You are persistant. Another time perhaps. Really though, thanks for this. It felt really good to tell someone. 
skip:
[$PlayerName]: No problem Syd. See you later.

skip:
[$PlayerName]: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be pushy. I just noticed you feeling down and wanted to help.
